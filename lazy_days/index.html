    <p>As my New Year's resolution in 2016, I vowed to never again make a meal at home. I found that cooking meals at home took time and effort, and the food never seemed to measure up to the greasy food that is readiy available at any old diner.</p>

    <p>Is your job taking too much time away from your rest and relaxation?? Does your alegebra homework keep you up at night? I used to be in the same boat until I quit work and school and devoted myself to doing absolutely nothing. Many people think that laziness is a vice, but I am here to tell you that it is an art.</p>
